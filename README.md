# 3rd Zigock Bot II for Yamagi Quake II

This is a best effort port of the  3rd Zigock Bot II to Yamagi Quake II. 
The code is nearly unchanged from the original, just some scary compiler
warning were fixes and some hard coded pathes were changed to make use
of Yamagi Quake IIs enhanced, unix compatible VFS.

## Installation

* Extract the ZIP archive *misc/assets.zip* to your Quake II directory.
* Build the game.so by calling `make` and copy it to the 3zb2/ dir.

For more informations refer to the user guide, included with the assets.
